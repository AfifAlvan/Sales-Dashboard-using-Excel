You don't need to bother with Tableau, Looker, or even Power BI. 
Moreover, there's no need to install applications like those to create a dashboard like this.
Every computer you have definitely has Microsoft Excel on it.
Let's check out the functionality within this dashboard.

2. Easy drag-and-drop features
3. Can be contained within a single Excel file
4. interconnected sheets

**DISADVANTAGES**

3. Can only work in one direction


STEPS
